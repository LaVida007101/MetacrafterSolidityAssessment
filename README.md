# MetacrafterSolidityAssessment
A Solidity-based smart contract to create and manage a token, developed as part of the Metacrafters Token Solidity Assessment.

## Desription
This project demonstrates the basic creation and management of a token using the Solidity programming language. The contract allows minting and burning tokens, tracking token balances, and managing the total supply.

Public Token Details: Stores token name, abbreviation, and total supply.
Address-to-Balance Mapping: Maps addresses to their respective token balances.
Mint Function: Increases total supply and updates the sender's balance.
Burn Function: Decreases total supply and reduces the sender's balance, ensures there are enough tokens to burn.
